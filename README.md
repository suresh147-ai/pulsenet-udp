## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how to use **pulsenet-udp** in your projects.

### Creating a UDP Socket

You can create a UDP socket using the provided API. Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <pulse/net/udp/socket.h>

int main() {
    pulse::net::udp::Socket socket;
    socket.bind(12345); // Bind to port 12345

    // Further socket operations...
}
```

### Sending Data

To send data, use the `send` method:

```cpp
socket.send("Hello, World!", "127.0.0.1", 12345);
```

### Receiving Data

Receiving data is just as straightforward:

```cpp
std::string message;
socket.receive(message);
std::cout << "Received: " << message << std::endl;
```

## Examples

You can find detailed examples in the `examples` directory. Each example demonstrates different features of the library, such as:

- Simple UDP client-server communication
- Handling multiple connections
- Error handling using `std::expected`
